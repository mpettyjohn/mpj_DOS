		<h2> <a id="five">The Five Strategy Influences </a></h2>
		<h3> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/11721966">Rumelt</a></h3>
		<p> Understand the challenge in front of you and respond coherently.</p>

		<h3> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32816087">Helmer</a></h3>
		<p> Strategy is about finding out if you have Power. This is a discovery process. It takes seeing in systems to be able to run this discovery process and exploit Power when it's found.</p>

		<h3> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker">Drucker</a></h3>
		<p> Opportunities are what make your business. Your strategy will probably fail because you don't see the opportunity in problems, you aren't building from strengths, you're chasing opportunities that are additive or complementary not breakthrough and your org probably doesn't have the ability to adapt to exploit breakthrough opportunities anyways.</p>

		<h3> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/638739">Deming</a></h3>
		<p> Have an aim and remember, the system determines performance.</p>

		<p> Be in a good industry, be a cost leader, or have a top brand.</p>

		<h2> <a id="not">What Strategy Is Not</a></h2>
		<p> Strategy is not a goal. "We want to grow to $200m in revenue" is an aspiration, not a strategy.</p>

		<p>Berson is pulling at the threads of five important ideas:</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Deterministic vs. Probabilistic </li>
				<p>- Do 'x' doesn't mean 'y' will happen. There's a probability it may happen or any number of other things may happen.</p>
			<li>The nature of complex dynamic systems</li>
				<p>- patterns of behavior can be unpredictable</p>
			<li>Humans are bundles of complexity</li>
				<p>- and they are the ones making up the complex systems you're operating in</p>
			<li>Unknowns and Unknowables</li>
				<p>- you could sit with the smartest people for years and not uncover everything that will happen once you go to enact your strategy</p>
			<li>Strategy is a discovery process that requires action</li>
		</ol>

		<p>What's the way to navigate this discovery process to account for a complex, probabilistic world? When new variables and knowledge are uncovered, how do you incorporate them?</p>

		<p>You need a learning process. Remember the scientific method? </p>

		<p>A brief history lesson:</p>

		<p><i>"Walter Shewhart introduced the business world to using the scientific method on its own operations in 1939 when he showed that the three steps of specification, production, and inspection, which were usually thought of as following one another in a straight line, should instead go in a circle or spiral."</i></p>

		<p>That sounds boring, but it's textbook innovation.</p>

		<p>Drucker, Deming, and Helmer all have elements of this structure in their work.</p>

		<p>I have learned to think of it as Plan > Do > Reflect > Iterate/Adapt/Abandon.</p>
		<p>Call it whatever you want but understand the principle: plan something, do something, learn from what happens, and do something with what you learned. Repeat forever.</p>

		<p>Strategy is like a stepping stone where the next move(s) aren't revealed until you take the next action. Successful strategy requires learning loops.</p>



		<h2> <a id="wild">Strategy In The Wild</a></h2>

		<p>Here are two examples of failed strategy in the real world that I was involved with. As my poker players know, the big losses get burned into memory more than the wins. They also offered learning opportunities that were bedrocks of my future successes.</p>

		<h4> Daimler Chrysler vs Ford </h4>
		<p> At the helm of Daimler Chrysler, CEO Jürgen Schrempp recognized that turning his company into a truly global automaker was table stakes for staying in business. Unfortunately, Schrempp's attempt to cobble together a global automaker was incoherent. Schrempp either didn't see, didn't acknowledge, or was unable to change the internal realities of the organizations he Frankensteined together. </p>
		<p>Schrempp failed the second part of Rumelt's basics on strategy, let Helmer down badly, and would have been scolded by Deming for not recognizing that culture is a part of the system and that the dysfunctional culture at DCX was Schrempp's responsibility.</p>
		<p> Meanwhile, during the same time period at Ford, Alan Mulally spearheaded one of the most improbable corporate turnarounds of the modern era. Having lived the DCX experience as a strategy consultant I was glued to the pages of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13132620-american-icon">Bryce Hoffman's</a> 2012 book and marveled at the contrast with DCX. Mulally had a crystal clear understanding of the challenge in front of him, understood that the limiting factor was Ford's culture, took responsibility for it, and molded the behemoth into a winner during the greatest economic unrest since The Great Depression.</p>
		<p> Strategy work lives in a world of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44318900"> wicked feedback</a>, which means <a href="https://www.driverlesscrocodile.com/books-and-recommendations/david-epstein-on-kind-and-wicked-learning-environments/">feedback</a>, if you ever get any can be late and incomplete. I was confident in my analysis and recommendations I provided DCX. They were rooted in a tremendous amount of interviews of people throughout the company that showed dysfunction at every level paired with a child's like imagination to pretend that dysfunction did not exist.</p>
		<p>It took a few years after my work with DCX ended for the company to implode and Shcrempp to be ousted. The analysis at this time gave me a chance to compare my own to how things played out with several of my big points being spot on. That was bittersweet though as clearly analysis and recommendations weren't anywhere near enough to deliver results.</p>
		<p> In cases like this there are always "what ifs." It wasn't until nearly ten years later that I read Hoffman's book about Ford during this era. It was feedback of a different nature and the closest thing to a "what if" scenario for DCX. Mulally's Ford was a case study in analyzing the challenge of the era, assumptions, and then execution. Much of what I recognized as ineffective and incoherent at DCX as well as how to change it, was present and happened at Ford. This feedback gave me the confidence to know that I wasn't just right, but I was right for the right reasons.</p>

		<h4> Logistix, my former startup</h4>
		<p> The third party freight logistics (3PL) world is a huge market that operates like an inefficient wild west. Company A makes something and needs to ship it. Company A contracts an intermediary to hire a truck. It's not uncommon to have two or three intermediaries make that happen. It's largely done by phone or email. In other words, software hasn't yet eaten 3PL.</p>
		<p> In this chaos I saw a platform play to bring a two-sided marketplace to manufacturers and shippers.</p>
		<p> My mistakes were myriad. When the platform didn't pan out I pivoted the company to become a tech-enabled broker. I'm proud of how well the people in our org adapted, but the pivot made no sense. The tech afforded us no pricing power in a cutthroat market. A business with no pricing power is no business at all. Those failings are my own because I didn't know when to quit. The opportunity cost of those years was not worth the modest exit we ultimately achieved.</p>
		<p> In a room filled with Drucker, Helmer, Rumelt, Deming, and Porter, Helmer takes the first shot, <i>"your business had no Power and you failed to recognize that for too long."</i> 
		<p>Porter calmly repeats my paraphrase of his work back to him. Looking over his glasses and down the bridge of his nose he asks in a professorial tone:</p> 
		<p><i>"Were you in a good industry with limited competition?"</i> </p>
			<p>No.</p>
		<p><i> Did you have pricing power?</i></p>
			<p>No. </p>
		<p><i> Could your customers demand lower prices and find a substitute if you didn't meet their demands?</i> </p>
			<p>Yes.</p>
